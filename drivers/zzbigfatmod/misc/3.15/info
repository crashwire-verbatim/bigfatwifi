These files are here to make the module more independent of the rest of the kernel
As a result this can be loaded on more kernels with less changes needed.
Also it will get a lot bigger (maybe even bigger than dhd.ko).
I might as well just include the whole kernel in this module.
Right now this is basically uhmm....
...who knows.
But no matter what it is, it will take a lot of time.
