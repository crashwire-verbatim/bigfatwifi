config CRC_ITU_T
	bool "enable crc-itu-t error check (required by rt73usb)"
	---help---
 	This is some eror-checking module that is being included
	in the bigfatwifi module because it is needed by the rt73usb driver.
	However if this module is already included in your kernel
	you don't need and should not compile this as part of the bigfatwifi module.
	This will be auto-selected by rt73usb

config EEPROM_93
	bool "enable eeprom for certain devices (required by rtl8187L)"
	---help---
	I have really no idea why this is needed but the module won't load
	without it if you have included rtl8187. 
	Anyways, it is better to inlcude it than not to.
	This will NOT be auto-selected. You need to do this yourself.
