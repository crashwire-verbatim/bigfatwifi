	  This section contains all the pre 802.11 and 802.11 wireless
	  device drivers. For a complete list of drivers and documentation
	  on them refer to the wireless wiki:

	depends on MAC80211
	---help---
	  This driver is a developer testing tool that can be used to test
	  IEEE 802.11 networking stack (mac80211) functionality. This is not
	  needed for normal wireless LAN usage and is only for testing. See
	  Documentation/networking/mac80211_hwsim for more information on how
	  to use this tool.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be
	  called mac80211_hwsim.  If unsure, say N.


config WIFI_CONTROL_FUNC
	bool "Enable WiFi control function abstraction"
	help
	  Enables Power/Reset/Carddetect function abstraction
